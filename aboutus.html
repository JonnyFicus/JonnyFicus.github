    <h1 style='text-align:center'>About Us</h1>
    <h4 style='text-align:center' class="text-muted">Welcome to Fuckus Repairs</h4>
      <pre style='text-align:center'>Hi, this is fairly straightforward, we are an outcall service
        for phone screen repair and replacement. There are only three
        questions, the What? Where? and How much? that need to be answered between you breaking your phone screen and it being repaired. </pre>

    <h4 style='text-align:center' class="text-muted">What do we Repair?</h4>
      <pre style='text-align:center'>We repair a variety of screen types, but pricing is currently
        only shown for Apple products.If you have another type of phone
        not listed, please contact us for pricing details. In some circumstances,
        additional damage may have occurred beyond the screen itself, and may
        require additional components to complete the repairs. Costs and time required will vary based on the needs of the individual circumstance.</pre>

    <h4 style='text-align:center' class="text-muted">Where Will the Repair be Completed</h4>
      <pre style='text-align:center'>When it comes to the "Where" question, that is up to you.
        We offer you the option of either driving to us near 7th Street
         and Loop 101, or we will come to you within a reasonable distance
         (sorry, no service to Tucson, etc). If we are coming to you,
         longer distances may incur a reasonable trip charge. Usually
         the trip charge will only be around $5 to $10, for example a trip to
         Gilbert would cost about $10 for a trip charge. If you have any
         questions about the exact additional costs to this, please contact us,
         providing the details, and we can make a firm pricing available to you.</pre>
