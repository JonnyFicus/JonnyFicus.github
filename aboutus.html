    <h1 style='text-align:center'>About Us</h1>
    <h2 style='text-align:center'>Welcome to Fuckus Repairs</h2>
      <p style='text-align:center'>Hi, this is fairly straightforward, we are an outcall <br>service for phone screen repair and replacement. <br>
        There are only three questions, the What? Where? and How much? <br>
        that need to be answered between you breaking your phone screen and it being repaired. </p>

    <h2 style='text-align:center'>What do we Repair?</h2>
      <p style='text-align:center'>We repair a variety of screen types, but pricing is currently only shown for Apple products.<br>
        If you have another type of phone not listed, please contact us for pricing details. In some circumstances, <br>
        additional damage may have occurred beyond the screen itself, and may require additional components to complete the repairs. <br>
        Costs and time required will vary based on the needs of the individual circumstance.</p>

    <h2 style='text-align:center'>Where Will the Repair be Completed</h2>
      <p style='text-align:center'>When it comes to the "Where" question, that is up to you. We offer you the option of either<br>
        driving to us near 7th Street and Loop 101, or we will come to you within a reasonable<br>
         distance (sorry, no service to Tucson, etc). If we are coming to you, longer distances may incur a reasonable trip charge. <br>
         Usually the trip charge will only be around $5 to $10, for example a trip to Gilbert would cost about $10 for a trip charge.<br>
          If you have any questions about the exact additional costs to this, please contact us, providing the details, and we can make a firm pricing available to you.</p>
